Do you know what you are capable of.
You will not know until you attempt to do it.

I know many of you explore lot of things like food, restaurants, gadgets, electronics, jewelry, clothes in the same way try to explore parks near you, tracks near you, streets around you, walk around run around go exploreeeee....explore yourself.

Do you know what's inside you do you want to expose it then get up and get out check your capability, explore your inside you,
see the wonders and surprises hidden inside you which no one knows, not even you if you dont try.

You see some one with a new apple phone and you buy it the next day the very next day..
You see someone running you just think I will start running tomorrow and that statement stays there and tomorrows come and go but you will still be waiting for that one tomorrow.
